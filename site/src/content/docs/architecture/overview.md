# Architecture Overview

UltraDAG is a lightweight DAG-BFT cryptocurrency designed from first principles for IoT and machine-to-machine micropayments. This page describes the system architecture, design philosophy, and how the major components fit together.

---

## Design Philosophy

Three principles guide every design decision in UltraDAG:

1. **Simplicity** — Every component must justify its complexity. The entire node compiles to a sub-3 MB stripped binary (~2.9 MB at v0.9). No virtual machine, no smart contracts, no account abstraction layers. Just a DAG-based ledger optimized for value transfer.

2. **Community-first governance** — The Council of 21 uses one-vote-per-seat governance with no stake requirement. Technical, business, legal, academic, and community seats ensure diverse representation. Stake does not buy governance power.

3. **Real decentralization** — The node runs on a $5/month VPS, or a $15 Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. If only well-funded entities can run nodes, the network is not decentralized. UltraDAG makes participation economically accessible — the binary is small enough, the storage bounded enough, and the CPU requirements modest enough that a single USB power bank can keep a validator online.

---

## System Architecture

*The system is composed of five crates: the ultradag-node binary (CLI and RPC server), ultradag-network (Noise transport, DAG sync, message routing), ultradag-coin (BlockDag, FinalityTracker, StateEngine, Mempool, ValidatorSet), ultradag-sim (VirtualNetwork and test scenarios), and ultradag-sdk (Rust SDK client). The RPC server connects to the DAG, state engine, and mempool. The network transport feeds into DAG sync and gossip, which connect to the BlockDag and mempool. The DAG feeds into finality, which feeds into the state engine, which manages the validator set.*

---

## Crate Structure

UltraDAG is organized as a Rust workspace with five crates:

| Crate | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `ultradag-coin` | Library | Consensus engine, DAG, finality, state machine, tokenomics, governance |
| `ultradag-network` | Library | P2P transport, Noise encryption, DAG sync protocol, rate limiting |
| `ultradag-node` | Binary | Node entry point, CLI parsing, RPC server, orchestration |
| `ultradag-sim` | Library + Tests | Deterministic simulation harness, fault injection, invariant checking |
| `ultradag-sdk` | Library | Rust SDK for programmatic node interaction |

### Dependency Graph

```
ultradag-node
├── ultradag-coin
├── ultradag-network
│   └── ultradag-coin
└── ultradag-sdk (optional)

ultradag-sim
├── ultradag-coin
└── (no network dependency — uses VirtualNetwork)
```

The simulation crate deliberately avoids depending on `ultradag-network`. It replaces TCP with a `VirtualNetwork` abstraction that supports perfect delivery, random ordering, message drops, and network partitions — all deterministically seeded.

## Core Data Flow

The fundamental data flow through an UltraDAG node:

1. **Vertex production**: The local validator creates a `DagVertex` referencing parents from the current DAG tip
2. **Gossip**: The vertex is broadcast to all connected peers via the P2P layer
3. **DAG insertion**: Received vertices are validated and inserted into the `BlockDag`
4. **Finality check**: The `FinalityTracker` checks if any vertices have achieved >2/3 validator coverage
5. **State application**: Newly finalized vertices are ordered deterministically and applied to the `StateEngine`
6. **Persistence**: Updated state is written to the `redb` database

*The data flows sequentially: the Validator produces a vertex into the BlockDag, the FinalityTracker checks for finality, finalized vertices are passed to the StateEngine for application, and the StateEngine persists state to the redb database.*

---

## Key Types

### DagVertex

The fundamental unit of the DAG. Each vertex contains:

- `validator: Address`: address of the producing validator
- `pub_key: [u8; 32]`: Ed25519 public key of the producing validator
- `round: u64`: monotonically increasing round number
- `parent_hashes: Vec<[u8; 32]>`: parent vertex hashes (up to `MAX_PARENTS=64`)
- `block: Block`: contains the coinbase transaction and a list of user transactions
- `signature: Signature`: Ed25519 signature over the vertex content
- `topo_level: u64`: topological level (computed on insert, not persisted)

The vertex hash is not stored as a field — it is computed via `DagVertex::hash()` using Blake3.

### BlockDag

The in-memory DAG structure. Holds vertices from the current window (after pruning). Provides:

- Vertex insertion with validation (signature, parent existence, round monotonicity)
- Parent selection for new vertex production
- Pruning of vertices below the pruning horizon

### FinalityTracker

Determines when vertices achieve BFT finality. Uses `BitVec` for O(1) per-vertex coverage tracking. A vertex is finalized when more than 2/3 of known validators (by count, not stake) have it as an ancestor. The BFT threshold is `ceil(2n/3)` by validator count.

### StateEngine

Derives account state from finalized DAG vertices. Maintains:

- Account balances and nonces
- Staking accounts (amount, commission)
- Delegation accounts (amount, validator, unlock round)
- Governance state (proposals, votes, council)
- Supply tracking with invariant enforcement

### ValidatorSet

Tracks the active and pending validator sets. Recalculated at epoch boundaries (every 210,000 rounds). Top 21 by effective stake become active.

## Conventions

UltraDAG follows strict code organization conventions:

- **`mod.rs` only re-exports** — no logic in module root files
- **Small files** — target < 200 lines per file, one concern per file
- **Inline unit tests** — every module has `#[cfg(test)]` tests
- **Integration tests** — cross-module tests live in `tests/`
- **No unsafe code** — zero instances of `unsafe` in the entire codebase
- **Comprehensive testing** — 836 tests across the core workspace
